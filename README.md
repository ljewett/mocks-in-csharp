# Studying mocks, fakes, doubles, and stubs with C#.

1. [Install dotnet core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/macos).
2. `cd` into this directory and run `dotnet build`.
3. `cd` into ClaimsTests and run `dotnet xunit` to run tests.

### Hints

Tests are written using [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core).

The [Moq4](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart) library is an excellent mocking library in C#.
