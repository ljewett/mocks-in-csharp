# Studying mocks, fakes, doubles, and stubs with C#.

1. Install dotnet core.
2. CD into this directory and run `dotnet build`.
3. CD into ClaimsTests and run `dotnet xunit` to run tests.

### Hints

Tests are written using [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core).
The [Moq4](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart) library is an excellent mocking library in C#.
